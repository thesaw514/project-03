### `Description`

Welcome to Project 03 of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program. In this project, students are challenged to develop a browser-based 'classic' arcade game that demonstrates their mastery (or current level) of the JavaScript object oriented programming language. The project as a whole makes use of a combination of: HTML, CSS, JS.

### `Instructions`

The goal is simple: reach the top tiles adjacent to the water's edge without falling victim to one of the fast approaching enemies!

Use the arrow keys ⬅️ ↕️ ➡️ to make your mad dash and guide your player to the safety of the other side.

Getting across won't be easy! The enemy beetles attack in groups and move in varying speeds, and once they make contact with you, you'll have to start your attempt all over.

### `How to Play`

To run the game - simply clone or download the project files to your local desktop and then open: *index.html* in your favorite web browser.

### `Dependencies`

None
